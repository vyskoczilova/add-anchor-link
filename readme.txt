== Frequently asked questions ==

= How can I report security bugs? =

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/add-anchor-links).

= I want to use the latest files. How can I do this? =

Use the GitHub Repo rather than the WordPress Plugin. Do as follows:

1. If you haven't already done: [Install git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

2. In the console cd into Your 'wp-content/plugins´ directory

3. Type `git clone https://github.com/vyskoczilova/add-anchor-links` or better type `git fork https://github.com/vyskoczilova/add-anchor-links`

4. If you want to update to the latest files (be careful, might be untested on Your WP-Version) type `git pull´.

= I found a bug. Where should I post it? =

I personally prefer GitHub, to keep things straight. The plugin code is here: [GitHub](https://github.com/vyskoczilova/add-anchor-links)
But you may use the WordPress Forum as well.

= I found a bug and fixed it. How can I contribute? =

Either post it on [GitHub](https://github.com/vyskoczilova/add-anchor-links) or—if you are working on a cloned repository—send me a pull request.
